// Raw block copy-through support for LOSSLESS repacking.
//
// The plain reader (mpq.go) looks files up by NAME, decrypts, and decompresses.
// That's perfect for editing a file — but useless for the many files a WC3 map
// stores that have NO name we can resolve: custom-imported models, textures,
// and sounds under war3mapImported/ that aren't enumerated by any (listfile)
// and aren't in the standard WC3 set. The hash table never stores filenames, so
// a name-based repack would silently DROP every such file and corrupt the map.
//
// RawEntries solves that by exposing, for every PRESENT hash slot, the file's
// on-disk identity (hashA/hashB/locale/platform) plus its raw stored block bytes
// verbatim — still compressed/encrypted exactly as they sit on disk. The writer
// (write.go) can re-emit those bytes byte-for-byte at a fresh offset and place
// the hash entry at the slot derived from (hashA, hashB), WITHOUT ever knowing
// the filename. This is precisely how StormLib/HiveWE preserve files they don't
// rewrite.
//
// The one case raw copy-through CANNOT preserve safely is a block whose
// encryption key is FILE-OFFSET dependent (FLAG_KEY_ADJUSTED, 0x00020000): the
// engine recomputes its decryption key from the block's file-relative offset, so
// relocating the raw bytes to a new offset would break FIX_KEY decryption — and
// we can't re-key it without the basename we don't have. RawEntry.NeedsName
// flags that case so the caller can fall back gracefully rather than emit a
// broken archive. WC3 maps virtually never hit this (their files are plain or
// merely FLAG_ENCRYPTED, whose key is offset-independent).
