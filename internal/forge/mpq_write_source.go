// This file holds the MPQ-backed save path: how a *mpqSource (defined in
// session.go) turns its buffered pending writes + tombstones into a freshly
// repacked .w3x on disk. Kept out of session.go's body to limit churn in that
// hot file while several agents edit it in parallel.

// mpqNameKey produces the case/slash-insensitive comparison key the buffered
// pending/deleted maps are keyed by. Mirrors the reader's normalisation
// (forward slash -> backslash, ASCII upper-fold) so "war3map.w3i" and
// "WAR3MAP.W3I" address the same buffered entry. The original (un-folded) name
// is preserved separately for re-packing — see flush, which tracks display
// names alongside.

// flush repacks the entire archive and atomically replaces the .w3x on disk.
//
// Why repack-the-world rather than splice individual files: the MPQ writer in
// internal/formats/mpq builds a fresh, self-consistent archive (header + hash
// table + block table + data) from a flat name->bytes set. Splicing one file
// into an existing archive in place would mean rewriting the hash/block tables
// AND every offset anyway, so a clean rebuild is both simpler and safer.
//
// Source of the file set:
//   - Every name the open archive declares (a.List() — the union of its
//     internal (listfile) and the standard WC3 name set, filtered to names
//     that actually resolve).
//   - Overlaid with this source's pending writes (new/changed bytes).
//   - Minus this source's tombstones (deleted files).
//
// The original HM3W/user-data preheader (the bytes before the MPQ header) is
// copied through verbatim so the lobby preview and any custom shunt survive.
//
// Atomicity + DO-NO-HARM: the repack writes to a sibling temp file and renames
// over the original only on full success (mpq.WriteFile handles this). If ANY
// step fails the original .w3x is left byte-for-byte untouched and the buffered
// changes stay pending so a later flush can retry. On success the buffers are
// cleared and the in-process archive handle is reopened so subsequent reads see
// the committed bytes.
//
// flush takes the source lock and delegates to flushLocked. forceRepackAll also
// holds the lock while it pre-populates the buffer, so the actual repack work
// lives in flushLocked (which assumes the lock is already held — sync.Mutex is
// not reentrant).
