# Wails postBuildHook: copy the vendored CascLib dylib next to the compiled
# binary inside the .app bundle.
#
# The Go side (internal/casc/casc.go) loads libcasc.dylib via purego.Dlopen.
# Its install_name is rewritten to @loader_path/libcasc.dylib by
# scripts/build-casclib-macos.sh, so the loader resolves it relative to the
# binary that called dlopen — which means the dylib must sit alongside that
# binary inside Contents/MacOS/. Without this hook the user gets the
# cryptic "dlopen ... image not found" at runtime (with zero units rendered).
#
# Wails v2 passes the freshly built binary path as $1 via the `${bin}`
# substitution in wails.json. On macOS that path is the inner Mach-O of the
# .app bundle, e.g. build/bin/wc3-forge.app/Contents/MacOS/wc3-forge. We
# take its parent directory as the destination. If the substitution ever
# changes to hand us the .app bundle root, we transparently descend into
# Contents/MacOS.

Build it once with:

This downloads CascLib upstream, compiles it via cmake, and drops the dylib
into scripts/casclib/. It's .gitignored — every dev machine builds its own.
