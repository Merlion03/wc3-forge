# Wails postBuildHook: copy vendored CASC DLLs next to the compiled binary.
#
# The Go side (`internal/casc/casc.go`) loads CascLib.dll via
# `syscall.NewLazyDLL`. It searches the executable's directory first, so the
# DLLs must sit next to `wc3-forge.exe` in `build/bin/` for the binary to be
# runnable straight out of the box. Without this hook the user has to remember
# to copy `scripts/casclib/*.dll` into `build/bin/` after every fresh build,
# and forgetting it produces the cryptic
#   "Failed to load CascLib.dll: The specified module could not be found."
# at runtime (with zero units rendered).
#
# Wails v2 runs postBuildHooks via `shell.RunCommand` (no shell expansion)
# with `build/bin/` as the working directory, so we resolve sources relative
# to $PSScriptRoot and copy them into the cwd by default. The caller may pass
# an explicit destination as the first argument (Wails passes the binary
# path via `${bin}`; we take its parent directory).

[CmdletBinding()]
param(
  # Wails substitutes `${bin}` with the path of the compiled binary.
  # If passed, we use its parent directory as the destination.
